# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time threat intelligence system and a risk
management framework for ShopSmart Solutions, an e-commerce platform. Each
group of five students will collaborate to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and assets
(TVA), conduct risk assessments, and implement risk treatment strategies. The project
will incorporate Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools, automation via Large Language
Models (LLMs), and alignment with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
