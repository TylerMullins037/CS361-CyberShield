## Introduction
Welcome to the ShopSmart Solutions Threat Intelligence Dashboard - your central command center for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security threats across your organization's digital infrastructure.

This user guide is specifically designed for blue team analysts and provides practical instructions on using the dashboard effectively to enhance your organization's security posture.

### Purpose of the Dashboard
The dashboard serves as a real-time threat intelligence platform that helps you:
- Monitor all digital assets in your environment
- Identify and prioritize security threats
- Understand risk levels and trends
- Implement effective mitigation strategies
- Generate comprehensive security reports

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard
The dashboard is accessible via your web browser at:

```
http://[your-server-address]/threat-dashboard
```

No additional software installation is required. The dashboard works best with Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browsers (latest versions).

### User Interface Basics
The dashboard uses a dark theme designed for visibility in security operations environments. The interface includes:
- Navigation bar at the top
- Summary cards for key metrics
- Filtering controls

- Detailed data tables

### Data Refresh
The dashboard automatically fetches data when you first load the page. To manually refresh the data:
- Click the refresh icon in the top-right corner of the navigation bar
- The "Last updated" timestamp will update to reflect the current time

Some elements, such as risk scores, automatically refresh every 5 seconds.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is organized into several key sections:

### 1. Summary Cards
Located at the top of the dashboard, these cards provide at-a-glance metrics:
- **Monitored Assets**: Total number of assets being tracked
- **Active Threats**: Current number of identified threats
- **High Risk Threats**: Number of threats with "High" risk classification
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Number of available mitigation recommendations

### 2. Report Generation Controls
Buttons for generating:
- CSV reports (for data analysis)
- PDF reports (for management presentations)

### 3. Enhanced Filtering Controls
Advanced filters for targeting specific threats based on:
- Severity
- Impact
- Threat type
- Risk score

### 4. Data Sections
- Asset Inventory
- Threat Intelligence Overview
- Risk Trend Analysis
- Threat Distribution
- Threat Data (network-focused)
- Mitigation Strategies
- Real-Time Risk Assessment

## Monitoring Assets

### Asset Inventory Section
The Asset Inventory section displays all digital assets under monitoring:

Key features include:
- **Name**: Asset identifier
- **Type**: Classification (server, database, network device, etc.)
- **Description**: Detailed information about the asset

### Filtering Assets
To focus on specific asset types:
1. Locate the "Filter by Type" dropdown in the top-right of the Asset Inventory section
2. Select the desired asset type from the dropdown menu
3. The table will automatically update to show only assets of the selected type
4. To return to viewing all assets, select "All Types" from the dropdown

### Asset Details
For more information about an asset, hover over the description field. The truncated description will expand to show the full text.

## Analyzing Threats

### Threat Intelligence Overview
The Threat Intelligence section displays detailed information about identified threats:

Key information includes:
- **Threat**: Name or description of the threat
- **Vulnerability**: The specific vulnerability being exploited
- **Likelihood**: Probability score (1-5) of the threat occurring
- **Impact**: Potential damage score (1-5) if the threat is realized
- **Risk**: Combined score and classification (Low/Medium/High)

### Threat Data Section
This section provides network-focused information:
- **IP Address**: Source or target IP addresses associated with threats
- **Ports**: Open ports identified during scanning
- **Services**: Running services that may be vulnerable

### Visual Analysis Tools
The dashboard includes several visualization tools:
1. **Risk Trend Analysis**: Chart showing historical risk trends over time
2. **Threat Distribution**: Pie chart showing proportion of threats by risk level
3. **Real-Time Risk Assessment**: Bar chart showing risk scores for all threats

## Advanced Threat Filtering

### Enhanced Filtering Controls
The dashboard provides comprehensive filtering capabilities:

Available filters include:
1. **Severity Filter**: Target threats by risk classification (High/Medium/Low)
2. **Impact Filter**: Focus on threats with specific impact levels (1-5)
3. **Threat Type Filter**: Filter threats by category
4. **Risk Score Filter**: Set minimum risk score threshold

### Using Filters
To apply filters:
1. Select values in any of the filter dropdown menus or input fields
2. The threat tables and charts will automatically update
3. Active filters are displayed as chips below the filter controls
4. Remove individual filters by clicking the 'X' on each filter chip

### Filter Results Summary
The dashboard shows a summary of your filter results:
- Number of threats displayed vs. total threats
- Active filter chips for quick reference

## Understanding Risk Scores

### Risk Calculation
Risk scores are calculated using the formula:

**Risk Score = Likelihood Ã— Impact**

Where:
- Likelihood is rated on a scale of 1-5
- Impact is rated on a scale of 1-5
- Risk Score ranges from 1-25

### Risk Classification
Risk scores are classified into three categories:
- **Low Risk** (Green): Scores 1-9
- **Medium Risk** (Orange): Scores 10-19
- **High Risk** (Red): Scores 20-25

### Risk Visualization
The dashboard uses consistent color coding throughout:
- Red for High Risk
- Orange for Medium Risk
- Green for Low Risk

This color coding appears in:
- The Threat Intelligence table (left border)
- Risk Assessment bar chart
- Threat Distribution pie chart

## Reviewing Mitigation Strategies

### Mitigation Strategies Section
This section provides recommended actions for addressing identified threats:

For each threat, you'll see:
- **Threat Name**: The specific threat being addressed
- **Strategies**: Recommended actions to mitigate the threat

### Implementing Mitigations
To implement mitigation strategies:
1. Prioritize based on risk scores (address high-risk threats first)
2. Review all recommended strategies for each threat
3. Follow your organization's change management procedures
4. Document actions taken
5. Monitor risk scores after implementation to verify effectiveness
