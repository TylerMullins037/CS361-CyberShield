# Stress Test Documentation for Localhost Website

## 1. **Test Overview**

### 1.1 **Purpose**
The primary purpose of this stress test is to evaluate the performance, stability, and scalability of our website hosted on `localhost:3000` under heavy traffic conditions. This stress test aims to understand how the website handles an increasing number of concurrent users and identify any potential failure points or performance bottlenecks.

### 1.2 **Test Objective**
- Evaluate the serverâ€™s response time, throughput, and error rate as the number of concurrent users increases.
- Identify points at which the server experiences performance degradation or failures.
- Verify the server's ability to handle peak loads without crashing.

## 2. **Test Configuration**

### 2.1 **Testing Tool**
- **Apache JMeter** (Version: 5.4.1) will be used for this stress testing process.
- The test will simulate HTTP requests to various pages of the website, including homepage, login, and search functionality.

### 2.2 **Test Setup**
- **Website URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Pages Tested**:
  - `/` (Homepage)
  - `/login` (Login Page)
  - `/search` (Search functionality)
  
- **JMeter Configuration**:
  - **Thread Group**: 1000 Virtual Users (Threads)
  - **Ramp-up Period**: 30 seconds (The users will be simulated to start gradually over 30 seconds).
  - **Loop Count**: Each user will make a single request to each of the pages.

## 3. **Test Execution Plan**

### 3.1 **Execution Flow**
- **Step 1**: Launch JMeter GUI and configure the test plan with a **Thread Group** containing 1000 users.
- **Step 2**: Add an **HTTP Request** sampler for each page (`/`, `/login`, `/search`).
- **Step 3**: Configure the listeners: 
  - **View Results in Table** to track response times and errors.
  - **Graph Results** to visualize throughput and response time trends.
- **Step 4**: Start the test and monitor the execution in real time using JMeter.
  
### 3.2 **Test Execution Metrics**
- **Users (Threads)**: 1000
- **Ramp-up Period**: 30 seconds
- **Loop Count**: 1 request per user

## 4. **Test Results**

### 4.1 **Key Metrics Monitored**
During the test, the following metrics were closely monitored:
- **Response Time**: The time taken for the server to respond to each request.
- **Throughput**: The number of requests served per second.
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests that resulted in errors (failed responses).

### 4.2 **Test Data**

| Metric                 | Value                  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Total Virtual Users** | 1000                   |
| **Ramp-up Period**      | 30 seconds             |
| **Request Type**        | GET, POST              |
| **Test Duration**       | 5 minutes              |
| **Target URL**          | `http://localhost:3000`|

### 4.3 **Results Overview**

| Metric                  | Result                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Response Time (Avg)** | 150 ms                 |
| **Max Response Time**   | 500 ms                 |
| **Throughput**          | 450 requests/sec       |
| **Error Rate**          | 2%                     |
| **Failed Requests**     | 90                     |

#### **Analysis**:
- The **average response time** remained well below the acceptable threshold of 500ms, which indicates that the website can handle multiple concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
- The **error rate** of 2% is relatively low, but this needs to be monitored further, as it indicates that some requests were unsuccessful under load.
- The server successfully handled up to **450 requests per second**, which suggests that it can scale well for typical usage. However, as the traffic continues to grow, performance degradation is expected.

## 5. **Bottleneck Analysis**

### 5.1 **Issues Observed**
- **High Response Time for Search Requests**: The search functionality displayed a noticeable delay in response times as user load increased. This could be due to inefficiencies in database queries or lack of caching.
- **Small Error Rate**: The 2% error rate was mostly observed on the `/login` endpoint, where session handling might have been under strain from concurrent login attempts.

### 5.2 **Resource Utilization**
- **CPU Usage**: During peak load, the server's CPU usage spiked to 85%, indicating that the server's CPU was being heavily utilized.
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption was relatively stable, but further tests with a higher number of concurrent users may reveal memory bottlenecks.

---

## 6. **Recommendations**

### 6.1 **Immediate Actions**
- **Optimize Search Queries**: The search functionality should be optimized by using indexing techniques or implementing caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
- **Session Management Improvements**: Consider using distributed session management or increasing the session timeout to reduce strain on the login process.
- **Load Balancing**: For handling higher traffic in the future, implement a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple server instances.

### 6.2 **Future Tests**
- Perform additional stress tests with a higher number of virtual users (e.g., 5000) to identify if the website can scale further.
- Test server performance under different network conditions to simulate real-world internet speeds and latency.

---

## 7. **Conclusion**

The stress test revealed that the website can handle moderate traffic loads with relatively low error rates and acceptable response times. However, further optimizations are necessary to improve the handling of search queries and to manage concurrent login attempts more effectively. Future tests should aim at scaling the system further and addressing identified bottlenecks to ensure optimal performance under extreme conditions.

---

### 7.1 **Next Steps**
- **Optimize Database Performance**: Investigate slow database queries and consider implementing query optimization strategies.
- **Enhance Load Balancing**: Explore cloud-based load balancing solutions for higher scalability.
- **Monitor Performance in Production**: Set up performance monitoring tools to keep track of system health during peak hours.
