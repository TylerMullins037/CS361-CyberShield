## **System Overview**

The ShopSmart Solutions Dashboard is a React-based application designed to monitor and display security threats, assets, and mitigation strategies. It features:

* Real-time threat intelligence monitoring  
* Asset inventory tracking  
* Risk assessment visualization  
* Filtering capabilities for threats and assets  
* Report generation in CSV and PDF formats  
* Interactive charts for data analysis

The dashboard communicates with a backend server running on port 5000 to fetch data through various API endpoints.

## **Prerequisites and Setup**

### **Required Dependencies**

The dashboard requires the following key dependencies:

* React  
* Material UI  
* Recharts for data visualization  
* Various Material UI icons

### **Server Configuration**

Ensure the backend server is properly configured:

Backend server must be running on http://localhost:5000  
API endpoints include:  
\- /api/assets  
\- /api/threats  
\- /api/threat\_data  
\- /api/mitigation-strategies  
\- /api/risk-trends  
\- /api/generate-csv-report

\- /api/generate-pdf-report

### **Common Setup Issues**

1. **Missing Dependencies**  
   * **Symptom**: Console errors about undefined components  
   * **Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed  
2. **Backend Connection Failed**  
   * **Symptom**: Dashboard shows empty tables and charts  
   * **Solution**: Verify the backend server is running on port 5000  
3. **CORS Issues**  
   * **Symptom**: API calls fail with CORS errors in console

**Solution**: Ensure the backend has proper CORS headers enabled:  
 javascript  
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");

* res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");

## **API Connection Issues**

### **Failed Data Fetching**

If the dashboard fails to load data:

Check that all API endpoints are operational by testing them directly:  
 curl http://localhost:5000/api/assets

1. curl http://localhost:5000/api/threats

2. Examine browser console for specific error messages  
3. Verify network connectivity between the client and server

### **Error Handling in API Calls**

The dashboard uses async/await for API calls with try/catch blocks. If you need to debug API issues, add logging to the catch blocks:

javascript  
try {  
  const assetsData \= await fetchAssets();  
  setAssets(assetsData);  
} catch (error) {  
  console.error("Detailed error fetching assets:", error);  
  *// You might want to add user-friendly error handling here*

}

### **Data Format Mismatches**

If data appears incorrectly or is missing:

1. Check the expected data format in the dashboard code  
2. Compare with the actual format returned by the API  
3. Look for null values or incorrect data types

## 

## 

## 

## **UI and Rendering Problems**

### **Theme Issues**

The dashboard uses a custom dark theme. If styling appears incorrect:

1. Verify that Material UI's ThemeProvider is wrapping the application  
2. Check if theme customizations in `darkTheme` are being applied  
3. Inspect browser dev tools to check which CSS rules are being applied

### **Component Rendering Problems**

For issues with specific components:

1. Check for conditional rendering that might prevent elements from displaying  
2. Verify that data arrays are correctly mapped to components  
3. Look for missing keys in mapped array elements

### **Empty Tables and Charts**

If tables or charts appear empty:

1. Check if the data arrays (assets, threats, etc.) are empty  
2. Verify that filtering logic isn't accidentally filtering out all items  
3. Check that chart components have correct dimensions and data props

## **Data Refresh and Real-time Updates**

### **Manual Refresh Issues**

If the refresh button doesn't update data:

1. Verify the `handleRefresh` function is being called  
2. Check that all API endpoints are being re-fetched  
3. Ensure state is being updated with new data

### **Automatic Updates**

The dashboard uses an interval for risk score updates:

javascript  
useEffect(() \=\> {  
  const interval \= setInterval(() \=\> {  
    setRiskScores(  
      threats.map((threat) \=\> ({  
        threat: threat.name,  
        risk: threat.risk\_score,  
        color: getRiskColor(threat.risk\_score)  
      }))  
    );  
  }, 5000);  
    
  return () \=\> clearInterval(interval);

}, \[threats\]);

If real-time updates aren't working:

1. Verify that the interval is running (add console logs for debugging)  
2. Check if the threats array is properly populated  
3. Ensure the component isn't unmounting prematurely

## **Filter Functionality Issues**

### **Filters Not Affecting Display**

If filtering doesn't work:

1. Check filter state variables (filterType, filterRisk, etc.)  
2. Verify filter implementation in the filter functions  
3. Look for logic errors in the filter conditions

For the enhanced threat filtering:

javascript  
const filteredThreats \= threats.filter(  
  (threat) \=\>   
    (\!filterRisk || threat.risk\_score \>= filterRisk) &&  
    (\!filterSeverity || getRiskLevel(threat.risk\_score) \=== filterSeverity) &&  
    (\!filterImpactLevel || threat.impact \=== parseInt(filterImpactLevel)) &&  
    (\!filterThreatType || threat.type \=== filterThreatType)

);

### **Filter Reset Problems**

If filters don't reset properly:

1. Verify that clicking the delete icon on filter chips calls the correct setter functions  
2. Check that empty string values are being used for reset states  
3. Test each filter reset separately to isolate issues

##

## **Report Generation Troubleshooting**

### **Failed CSV/PDF Generation**

If report generation fails:

1. Check console for error messages from the API calls

Verify the backend endpoints are correctly implemented:  
 /api/generate-csv-report

2. /api/generate-pdf-report

3. Ensure the file paths returned by the API are correct

### **Download Issues**

If reports generate but don't download:

1. Check the response format from the API  
2. Verify that `window.location.href` is being set correctly  
3. Check browser download settings and permissions

## **Chart and Visualization Problems**

### **Charts Not Rendering**

If charts don't appear:

1. Check that container dimensions are properly set  
2. Verify the data format matches what Recharts expects  
3. Look for errors in chart configuration

### **Data Visualization Issues**

For incorrect chart displays:

1. Verify domain settings for axes:  
    javascript  
   \<YAxis domain\={\[0, 25\]} /\>

2. Check data transformations that feed into charts  
3. Ensure color mappings are correct

### **Dynamic Chart Updates**

If charts don't update with new data:

1. Verify that chart data state is being updated  
2. Check dependencies in useEffect hooks  
3. Ensure parent components are re-rendering when needed

## **Performance Optimization**

### **Slow Loading**

If the dashboard loads slowly:

1. Consider implementing pagination for large data tables  
2. Add loading states for individual components  
3. Optimize data fetching with batched requests

### **Memory Leaks**

To prevent memory leaks:

1. Ensure all intervals and timeouts are cleared on component unmount  
2. Check for proper cleanup in useEffect hooks  
3. Verify that event listeners are removed when not needed

## **Common Error Messages**

### **"Failed to fetch"**

This typically indicates network issues:

1. Check server status  
2. Verify API endpoints  
3. Check for CORS issues

### **"Cannot read property 'X' of undefined/null"**

This indicates a data structure issue:

1. Add null checks before accessing nested properties  
2. Use optional chaining for safer property access:  
    javascript  
   const threatName \= threat?.name || 'Unknown';

3. Provide fallback values for missing data

## **Maintenance Procedures**

### **Regular Updates**

Perform these tasks regularly:

1. Check for library updates, especially for Material UI and Recharts  
2. Monitor API endpoint performance  
3. Review error logs for recurring issues

### **Backup Procedures**

Implement backup procedures for:

1. Dashboard configuration  
2. Custom theming settings  
3. User preferences and filter settings

### **Performance Monitoring**

Monitor these performance metrics:

1. API response times  
2. Component render times  
3. Memory usage during extended sessions
